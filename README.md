##Introduction (✧∀✧)/ :  What is this project?

It is an intelligent recommendation system that helps users find tech products within their budget.
It also suggests optimal devices based on the user's profile (still working on that).


##Project Purpose (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧ :

Finding the right device can be overwhelming with countless specifications.


##Getting Started: How can someone set it up and run it 	(¬‿¬ )?
## Setup Instructions

1. Rename `config.example.py` to `config.py`
2. Open `config.py` and add your Qdrant URL and API key
3. Run the application


1.Create the virtuelenv by the commend
     ☺ macOS/Linux: python3 -m venv .venv
     ☺ Windows (Command Prompt): python -m venv venv
     ☺ Windows (PowerShell): python -m venv venv
     
2.Activate the Environment
    ○ macOS/Linux (Bash/Zsh): source venv/bin/activate
    ○ Windows (Command Prompt): .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ○ Windows (Powershell):  .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    :/ If you are on Windows and get a red error message saying Execution_Policies or "scripts are disabled on this system," it’s a very common security roadblock in PowerShell.
    just copy and paste  : Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
    and activate your Environment (●'◡'●)
3.install the requirements 
    just type in your terminal :
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    
3.Run the code

     streamlit run main.py

Running this command will start a local web server and open your app in a new tab in your default web browser.
note : the first thing you have to do when you open the app is to push the buttom PUSH DATA TO CLOUD
